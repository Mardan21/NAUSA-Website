              August 8th, 2023, in Fairfax, Virginia, emerged as a collaborative
              effort orchestrated by representatives and coaches hailing from
              eight distinct Uyghur football clubs dispersed across North
              America. These clubs include Uyghur United FC, Maryland Uyghur FC,
              Yulghun FC, California Uyghur FC, Bogda FC, Boston & NY Uyghur

              The establishment witnessed the election of five permanent board
              members, meticulously chosen from the aforementioned football
              clubs. These individuals were entrusted with the responsibility of
              articulating and safeguarding the foundational principles and
              overarching vision of the organization. Simultaneously, a quintet
              of board trustees assumed their roles for a three-year term,
              vested with the authority to oversee and administer the
              operational facets of the association. Within this cadre, distinct
              responsibilities were apportioned, designating roles such as
              chairman, treasurer, team liaison, event coordinator, and
              media/marketing director to individual trustees.
